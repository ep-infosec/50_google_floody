  <h1>Floody Security and Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  The Floody tool is an HTML interface which allows users to connect
  to Campaign Manager via the
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/trafficking_overview">
    Campaign Manager API
  </a>.
  Users can only connect to Campaign Manager if they already have a User Profile set up in Campaign
  Manager as well as the permissions required to manage Floodlight
  activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Floody tool allows the users to push Floodlight Activities to Google Tag Manager at bulk.
  The system stores email addresses in a database when using "Export to GTM" feature for authorizing
  actions related to GTM requests: view, approve and reject.
  <br/>
  Following users' email address are stored:
  <ul>
    <li>Request Creator</li>
    <li>Approver(s)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  In connecting and managing Floodlight-related content in Campaign
  Manager via API, the Floody tool does not do anything that is not
  covered by Campaign Manager security and privacy policies. In fact,
  Floody accesses very few areas that are actually available via API.
  <h3>Usage of permissions</h3>
  Granted Google permissions are used as follows, your security
  tokens are <b>not</b> stored.
  <ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">
      <i>Google Profile</i> is used only to show user photo and name on the app, it is <b>not</b>
      logged or stored.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">
      <i>Spreadsheets</i> permission is used to ascertain your access to the given spreadsheet and
      allow you to share the spreadsheet with others.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">
      <i>DCM Trafficking</i> permission is used to perform action on your behalf in Campaign Manager
      using the API.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">
      <i>Google Tag Manager Editor</i> permission is used to perform action on your behalf to push the
      Floodlight Activities to GTM.
    </li>
  </ul>
